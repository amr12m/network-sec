# Network Security Project: Packet Sniffing

## Overview
This project is aimed at exploring and implementing packet sniffing techniques for network security analysis. Packet sniffing is a method used to intercept and log network traffic. This can be crucial for understanding network behavior, identifying vulnerabilities, and ensuring the security of data in transit.

## Features

- **Packet Capture:** The project allows capturing network packets in real-time.
  
- **Protocol Analysis:** It includes the ability to analyze and interpret various network protocols.

- **Filtering:** Users can set filters to focus on specific types of traffic or protocols.

- **Logging:** Captured packets are logged for further analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Wireshark or tcpdump (optional, for offline packet analysis)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amr12m/network-sec.git)https://github.com/amr12m/network-sec.git
```
